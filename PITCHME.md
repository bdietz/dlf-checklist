@title[RDC approach]
### Research Data Committee
- Targeted and nimble approach
- DMPs, workshops, copyright, promotion, and compliance
- Focused on supporting researchers up to the point of grant application
- Looking for strategic way to assist researchers with what happened post-award
Note: The Libraries RDC has been operating in an organized way since 2011. The committee consists of a core team supplemented with members who rotate off and on on 3 year terms. The work of the RDC has been targeted and nimble, and has featured a DMP review service and internal workshops. The focus of the work has been on supporting researchers up to the point of their grant application. As our DMP service has becoming more mature and more active, there's been a desire to offer services to researchers that would help with their management of their data post-award.

@title[Post-Award Checklist]
### Post-Award Checklist
Note: The tool we've recently developed is what we call a "Post Award Checklist"
---
@title[Checklist]
### Why a checklist for researchers?

> A checklist is a type of informational job aid used to reduce failure by compensating for **potential limits of human memory and attention**. It helps to ensure **consistency and completeness** in carrying out a task.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Checklist

Note: Why might a checklist be useful? As a tool it compensates for the limits of our mental capacity, could help, say, a Material Sciences and Engineering researchers also be a bit of an information professional (a data manager).
---
@title[Investment]
### Why a Checklist for the committee?
- Relatively low commitment
- Potentially high impact
- Iterative process
Note: Now from the RDC's perspective, a checklist was attractive because we could quickly prototype a tool that might have an impact. Alternately, if it's a failure, it would have been a fairly small investment of time. Either way, the process could be iterative: we could roll something out, get feedback, improve, and repeat.

@title[Environmental scan]
### Environmental Scan
- Poked around web (unsystematic)
- Emailed DataCure list
- Responses
 - Data Stewardship Action Team
 - Johns Hopkins University Libraries
 - National Center for Atmospheric Research
Note: Naturally we started with an environmental scan to make sure others hadn't already done this. We started by poking around the web, which was inefficient. Bertha ultimately sent a message to the DataCure list. We receive three responses. One was the Data Stewardship Action Team (which was still in development and looked to require more technical build time than we were willing to invest); one was Johns Hopkins (oriented to DMP reviews); one was from the National Center for Atmospheric Research (well-developed but specialized to them). The responses and non-responses seemed to indicate both support and a lack.
---
@title[Audience]
### For a general audience, by generalists
Note: We could not tailor a checklist for a certain domain or lab, and we did not want to presume too much about how researchers conduct their research
---
@title[Research Lifecycle]
### Data Lifecycle as Map for Data Management
> ...you principally have to worry about the data management practices for whatever part of the lifecycle you are currently in...

Kristin Briney, [Data Management for Researchers](http://dataabinitio.com/?page_id=672)
Note: The most logical organizing principle seemed to be the research data lifecycle.
---
@title[Research Lifecycle]
### Data Lifecycle
<img src="assets/research-lifecycle.png" alt="Research Lifecycle models" width="1000px" height="456px">

Note: So, we started by referencing various data lifecycle models. If you haven't looked recently there are lot out there, some are extremely complicated and would not map to a checklist, and we wanted to make this a simple tool for researchers to use. We ultimately found Kristin Briney's Data Management for Researchers to be the most useful model.
---
@title[Research Lifecycle]
### Lifecycle: Sections
- Before you begin
- As you begin your research
- As you’re acquiring and analyzing
- When it’s time to publish
- When it’s time to share
- When it’s time to “preserve” your output
- When it’s all done
- All along the way
Note: And, while Briney uses pretty user friendly labels, we wanted to make it even friendlier. And we tried to break up the lifecycle into simple sections that excluded jargon and would map across domains.
---
@title[Checklist Items]
### Checklist Items
- Roles
- Documentation
- File management
- Backup and preservation
- Identifying repositories
Note: The items on the checklist include documentation, file management, preservation, and ways to share data.
---
@title[Resources]
### Resources
- Their own DMP
- The Libraries
- IRB
- Campus IT
- College research officers
Note: We also refer users to the IRB, campus IT, and college research officers, various campus resources, and, of course, their own plan.
---
@title[Checklist examples]
### Examples
- [ ] Establish “data documentation” (revise as project continues), i.e., metadata
- [ ] Identify a venue or repository that is an appropriate place to share data with your domain/community
- [ ] Consider a consultation with someone from the Libraries
Note: Here are a couple examples of items.
---
@title[Sharing]
### Sharing as a Google Doc
- Quick to deploy
- Easy to share
- Add to your Drive as edit as necessary
- Iterate if/when necessary (version control, too)

http://go.ncsu.edu/post-award_dmpchecklist
Note: We created our working draft in google doca, but then decided it was the ideal way to share early versions. One appeal, since we knew our version couldn't cover specifics of all users, is that researchers can add it to their own Drives and edit as needed.
---
@title[Campus feedback]
### Campus Feedback
- Institutional Review Board
- Office of Research, Innovation, and Economic Development
Note: To date we have shared with a limited audience. Our campus IRB reviewed it and advised that the checklist would be useful for when researchers were completing their IRB applications. Their hope was tighter integration between DMP and checklist with IRB. Our Office of Research, Innovation, and Economic Development has also reviewed it.
---
@title[Annotated copy]
### Public vs Annotated Copies

> Good checklists...are precise. They are efficient, to the point, and easy to use...They do not try to spell out everything...

Atul Gawande, [Checklist Manifesto](http://atulgawande.com/book/the-checklist-manifesto/)

Note: The initial draft was much more detailed than the latest version. After reviewing the document with other committee members, we decided to move some items into comments that liaisons could refer to when meeting with faculty to discuss implementing the checklist. The staff full-edit version contain annotations that are not visible in the public, read-only view. The result is that we have one canonical copy to manage.
---
@title[Additional work]
### Ongoing and future work
- Contacting researchers
- Web presence
- Promotion to community
Note: We have identified three researchers whose DMPs we reviewed and whose applications were funded. Future work includes contacting and meeting them to discuss how they might use the checklist. We also need to establish a better web presence for the tool, and promote it to the community.
---
@title[Campus Support]
### Campus Support
- [IRB Submission Guidance page](https://sites.textiles.ncsu.edu/research/data-mangagement)
- [College of Textiles Research Resources site](https://sites.textiles.ncsu.edu/research/data-mangagement)
Note: To that end our IRB and College of Textiles are both sharing the checklist from their sites.
