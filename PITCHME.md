@title[Checklist]
### Checklist
A checklist is a type of informational job aid used to reduce failure by compensating for potential limits of human memory and attention. It helps to ensure consistency and completeness in carrying out a task.

@title[Investment]
### Investment
- Relatively low commitment
- Potentially high impact
- Iterative process
Note: Wouldn't over commit us to a tool that researchers may not take up; BUT might have an big impact with relatively small investment
---
@title[Environmental scan]
### Environmental Scan
- Poked around web (unsystematic)
- Emailed DataCure list
- Responses
 - Data Stewardship Action Team
 - Johns Hopkins University Libraries
 - National Center for Atmospheric Research
Note: DSAT (complicated, not ready for prime time); JHS (oriented to DMP reviews); NCAR (well-developed but specialized to them); seemed to indicate an interest and a need
---
@title[Audience]
### Audience
For a general audience, by generalists
Note: We could not tailor a checklist for a certain domain or lab, and we did not want to presume too much about how researchers conduct their research

@title[Annotated copy]
### Public vs Annotated Copies
> Good checklists...are precise. They are efficient, to the point, and easy to use...They do not try to spell out everything...

Atul Gawande, [Checklist Manifesto](http://atulgawande.com/book/the-checklist-manifesto/)
Note: Manage as a Google doc for now; public copy is read-only; staff copy has annotations as comments that may help liaisons in discussing checklist with researchers
