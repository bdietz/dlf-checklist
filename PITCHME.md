@title[Research Data Committee]
### Research Data Committee
- Core team with rotating membership
- Draws from across Libraries
- Extends expertise beyond specialists
Note: Since around 2011...
---
@title[RDC approach]
### Targeted and Nimble
- DMPs, workshops, compliance, promotion
- Focused on supporting up to the point of grant application
- Looking for strategic way to assist researchers with what happened post-award
Note: Since around 2011...

## Checklist

@title[Checklist]
> ...Know-how is often unmanageable...

@title[Checklist]
### Checklist
A checklist is a type of informational job aid used to reduce failure by compensating for potential limits of human memory and attention. It helps to ensure consistency and completeness in carrying out a task.

@title[Investment]
### Investment
- Relatively low commitment
- Potentially high impact
- Iterative process
Note: Wouldn't over commit us to a tool that researchers may not take up; BUT might have an big impact with relatively small investment
---
@title[Environmental scan]
### Environmental Scan
- Poked around web (unsystematic)
- Emailed DataCure list
- Responses
 - Data Stewardship Action Team
 - Johns Hopkins University Libraries
 - National Center for Atmospheric Research
Note: DSAT (complicated, not ready for prime time); JHS (oriented to DMP reviews); NCAR (well-developed but specialized to them); seemed to indicate an interest and a need
---
@title[Audience]
### Audience
For a general audience, by generalists
Note: We could not tailor a checklist for a certain domain or lab, and we did not want to presume too much about how researchers conduct their research
---
@title[Research Lifecycle]
<img src="assets/research-lifecycle.png" alt="Research Lifecycle models" width="1000px" height="456px">
Note: We started by referencing various research lifecycle models. There are lot to choose from, some are extremely complicated and would not map to a checklist, and we wanted to make this a simple tool for researchers to use.

@title[Research Lifecycle]
### Research Lifecycle
- Kristin Briney, [Data Management for Researchers](http://dataabinitio.com/?page_id=672)
Note: https://catalog.lib.ncsu.edu/record/NCSU3913377 We ultimately found Kristin Briney's Data Management for Researchers to be the most useful model.

@title[Research Lifecycle]
### Lifecycle: Sections
- Before you begin
- As you begin your research
- As you’re acquiring and analyzing
- When it’s time to publish
- When it’s time to share
- When it’s time to “preserve” your output
- When it’s all done
- All along the way
Note: edit

@title[Jargon]
### Avoided Jargon
Note: edit
---
@title[Sharing]
### Sharing as a Google Doc
http://go.ncsu.edu/post-award_dmpchecklist
- Quick to deploy
- Easy to share
- Iterate if/when necessary
Note: We created the checklist as google doc, but then we decided it was the best form for sharing, also.
---
@title[Annotated copy]
### Public vs Annotated Copies
> Good checklists...are precise. They are efficient, to the point, and easy to use...They do not try to spell out everything...

Atul Gawande, [Checklist Manifesto](http://atulgawande.com/book/the-checklist-manifesto/)
Note: Manage as a Google doc for now; public copy is read-only; staff copy has annotations as comments that may help liaisons in discussing checklist with researchers
---
@title[Campus feedback]
### Campus Feedback
- Institutional Review Board
- Office of Research, Innovation, and Economic Development
Note: IRB advise to use the checklist while completing the IRB application; tighter integration bt DMP and checklist with IRB; IRB links out to checklist as a resource
---
@title[Additional work]
### Ongoing and future work
- Contacting researchers
  - Research Admin Data and Reporting follow up
- Web presence
- Promotion to community
Note: edit
---
@title[Campus Support]
### Campus Support
- [IRB Submission Guidance page](https://sites.textiles.ncsu.edu/research/data-mangagement)
- [College of Textiles Research Resources site](https://sites.textiles.ncsu.edu/research/data-mangagement)

@title[Monitoring]
### Monitoring use
Note: NCSU link shortener, one way to track; additional web tracking via Google Analytics
