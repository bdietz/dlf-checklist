Bertha Chang | Sonoe Nakasone
Note: Collaboration with Bertha and Sonoe, as well as others on RDC

@title[Research Data Committee]
### Research Data Committee
- Core team with rotating membership
- Draws from across Libraries
- Extends expertise beyond specialists
Note: Since around 2011...
---
@title[RDC approach]
### Targeted and Nimble
- DMPs, workshops, compliance, promotion
- Focused on supporting up to the point of grant application
- Looking for strategic way to assist researchers with what happened post-award
Note: Since around 2011...
---
@title[Investment]
### Investment
- Relatively low commitment
- Potentially high impact
- Iterative process
Note: Wouldn't over commit us to a tool that researchers may not take up; BUT might have an big impact with relatively small investment
---
@title[Environmental scan]
### Environmental Scan
- Poked around web (unsystematic)
- Emailed DataCure list
- Responses
 - Data Stewardship Action Team
 - Johns Hopkins University Libraries
 - National Center for Atmospheric Research
Note: DSAT (complicated, not ready for prime time); JHS (oriented to DMP reviews); NCAR (well-developed but specialized to them); seemed to indicate an interest and a need

@title[Checklist]
### Checklist "Theory"

@title[Checklist]
### Checklist
> A checklist is a type of informational job aid used to reduce failure by compensating for **potential limits of human memory and attention**. It helps to ensure **consistency and completeness** in carrying out a task.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Checklist
Note: So, everyone knows what a checklist is. ToDo lists are a form of checklist that have been riding a wave of popularity for a long while. Mainly because they're useful. Why? Because of the limits of human memory. We're not able to remember all of our assignments that come out of a meeting. Or all of the steps that are required to complete a workflow.

@title[Checklist]
> ...Know-how is often unmanageable...

Atul Gawande, [Checklist Manifesto](http://atulgawande.com/book/the-checklist-manifesto/)
Note: Atul Gawande, who wrote a short and engaging book on checklists, wrote "know-how is often unmanageable"
---
@title[Scope and Length]
> Good checklists...are precise. They are efficient, to the point, and easy to use...They do not try to spell out everything...

Atul Gawande, [Checklist Manifesto](http://atulgawande.com/book/the-checklist-manifesto/)
Note: He also wrote that they're precise, efficient, easy to use, and not comprehensive. Checklists are used widely by airline pilots, but, as Gawande has said, the checklist doesn't fly the plane. It just helps the pilots make sure everything is in order before they tear off of the earth.

@title[Audience]
### Audience
For a general audience, by generalists
Note: We could not tailor a checklist for a certain domain or lab, and we did not want to presume too much about how researchers conduct their research
---
@title[Research Lifecycle]
<img src="assets/research-lifecycle.png" alt="Research Lifecycle models" width="1000px" height="456px">
Note: We started by referencing various research lifecycle models. There are lot to choose from, some are extremely complicated and would not map to a checklist, and we wanted to make this a simple tool for researchers to use.
---
@title[Research Lifecycle]
### Research Lifecycle
- Kristin Briney, [Data Management for Researchers](http://dataabinitio.com/?page_id=672)
Note: https://catalog.lib.ncsu.edu/record/NCSU3913377 We ultimately found Kristin Briney's Data Management for Researchers to be the most useful model.
---
@title[Research Lifecycle]
### Lifecycle: Sections
- Before you begin
- As you begin your research
- As you’re acquiring and analyzing
- When it’s time to publish
- When it’s time to share
- When it’s time to “preserve” your output
- When it’s all done
- All along the way
Note: Tried to break down the lifecycle into simple sections that excluded jargon and would map across domains. So we used broad categories like before you do X, as you're doing Y, all along the way.
---
@title[Checklist Items]
### Checklist Items
Four pages, 35 items
- Roles
- Documentation
- File management
- Backup and preservation
- Identifying repositories
Note:
---
@title[Resources]
### Resources
- Their own DMP
- The Libraries
- IRB
- Campus IT
- College research officers
Note: Other than their own DMP and the Libraries, we also refer checklist users to the IRB, campus IT, and college research officers, among other campus resources
---
@title[Sharing]
### Sharing as a Google Doc
http://go.ncsu.edu/post-award_dmpchecklist
- Quick to deploy
- Easy to share
- Iterate if/when necessary
Note: We created the checklist as google doc, but then we decided it was the best form for sharing, also.
---
@title[Annotated copy]
### Public vs Annotated Copies
Note: Manage as a Google doc for now; public copy is read-only; staff copy has annotations as comments that may help liaisons in discussing checklist with researchers
---
@title[Campus feedback]
### Campus Feedback
- Institutional Review Board
- Office of Research, Innovation, and Economic Development
Note: IRB advise to use the checklist while completing the IRB application; tighter integration bt DMP and checklist with IRB; IRB links out to checklist as a resource
---
@title[Additional work]
### Ongoing and future work
- Contacting researchers
  - Research Admin Data and Reporting follow up
- Web presence
- Promotion to community
Note: edit
---
@title[Campus Support]
### Campus Support
- [IRB Submission Guidance page](https://sites.textiles.ncsu.edu/research/data-mangagement)
- [College of Textiles Research Resources site](https://sites.textiles.ncsu.edu/research/data-mangagement)

@title[Monitoring]
### Monitoring use
Note: NCSU link shortener, one way to track; additional web tracking via Google Analytics
