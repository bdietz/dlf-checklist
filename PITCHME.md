### Checklist
A checklist is a type of informational job aid used to reduce failure by compensating for potential limits of human memory and attention. It helps to ensure consistency and completeness in carrying out a task.

### Nimble
- Quick turnaround
- Commitment
- Iterative

@title[Environmental scan]
### Environmental scan
- Emailed DataCure list
- Responses
 - Data Stewardship Action Team
 - Johns Hopkins University Libraries
 - National Center for Atmospheric Research
Note: DSAT (complicated, not ready for prime time); JHS (oriented to DMP reviews); NCAR (well-developed but specialized to them); seemed to indicate an interest and a need

@title[Audience]
### Audience
For a general audience, by generalists
Note: We could not tailor a checklist for a certain domain or lab, and we did not want to presume too much about how researchers conduct their research
