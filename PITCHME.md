@title[RDC approach]
### Research Data Committee (RDC)
- Targeted and nimble approach
- DMPs, workshops, copyright, promotion
- Focused on supporting researchers up to the point of grant application
- Looking for strategic way to assist researchers with what happened post-award
Note: The Libraries Research Data committee has been in around since 2011. The committee consists of a core team supplemented with members who serve 3 year terms. The work of the RDC has been targeted and nimble, and has featured services like a DMP review, internal workshops, promotion, and other activities. The focus of our work has been on supporting researchers up to the point of their grant applications. As our DMP service has becoming more mature and more active, there's been a desire to offer services to researchers that would help with the management of their data post-award.

@title[Post-Award Checklist]
### Post-Award Checklist
Note: The tool we've recently developed is what we call a "Post Award Checklist"
---
@title[Checklist]
### Why a checklist for researchers?

> A checklist is a type of informational job aid used to reduce failure by compensating for **potential limits of human memory and attention**. It helps to ensure **consistency and completeness** in carrying out a task.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Checklist

Note: Why might a such a thing be useful? A checklist functions to compensate for the limits of mental capacity, and are effective in dealing with complicated tasks...such as what a Material Sciences and Engineering researcher might face when managing her data while also trying to manage her research project.

@title[Investment]
### Why a Checklist for the committee?
- Relatively low commitment
- Potentially high impact
- Iterative process
Note: From the RDC's perspective, a checklist is attractive because we could quickly prototype a tool that, if successful, would have an impact, and, if not, would have been a fairly small investment of time. The process could also be easily iterated: we could roll something out, get feedback, improve, and repeat.

@title[Environmental scan]
### Environmental Scan
- Poked around web (unsystematic)
- Emailed DataCure list
- Responses
 - Data Stewardship Action Team
 - Johns Hopkins University Libraries
 - National Center for Atmospheric Research
Note: Our work started with an environmental scan to make sure others hadn't already done something like this. We started by poking around the web, which was inefficient and led to Bertha ultimately sending an inquiry to the DataCure list. We received three responses. One was from the Data Stewardship Action Team (whose product was still in development and looked to require more technical build time than we were willing to invest); one was from Johns Hopkins (which was oriented to their DMP reviews); and one was from the National Center for Atmospheric Research (which closely matched what we envisioned but was specialized to their organization).
---
@title[Audience]
### For a general audience, by generalists
Note: Starting off in designing our version, we realized that we could not tailor a checklist for a specific domain or lab, and we did not want to presume too much about how researchers conduct their research.
---
@title[Research Lifecycle]
### Data Lifecycle as Organizing Principle
> ...you principally have to worry about the data management practices for whatever part of the lifecycle you are currently in...

Kristin Briney, [Data Management for Researchers](http://dataabinitio.com/?page_id=672)
Note: We wanted to organize the checklist so that it followed the research data lifecycle, so we started looking at various models.
---
@title[Research Lifecycle]
### Data Lifecycle
<img src="assets/research-lifecycle.png" alt="Research Lifecycle models" width="1000px" height="456px">

Note: If you haven't looked recently there are lot out there. Some are extremely complicated and would not map to a checklist, and we wanted to make a simple tool that was easy to use. We ultimately found Kristin Briney's model, from her Data Management for Researchers, to be the most useful model.
---
@title[Research Lifecycle]
### Lifecycle: Sections
- Before you begin
- As you begin your research
- As you’re acquiring and analyzing
- When it’s time to publish
- When it’s time to share
- When it’s time to “preserve” your output
- When it’s all done
- All along the way
Note: While Briney uses pretty user friendly labels, we wanted to make it even friendlier. We tried to break up the lifecycle into simple sections that excluded jargon and would be applicable across domains.
---
@title[Checklist Items]
### Checklist Items
- Roles
- Documentation
- File management
- Backup and preservation
- Identifying repositories
Note: Checklist items address things like roles, documentation, file management, preservation, data sharing.
---
@title[Resources]
### Resources
- Their own DMP
- The Libraries
- IRB
- Campus IT
- College research officers
Note: We also refer users to the IRB, campus IT, their college research officers, and, of course, their own data management plan.
---
@title[Checklist examples]
### Examples
- Establish “data documentation” (revise as project continues), i.e., metadata
- Identify a venue or repository that is an appropriate place to share data with your domain/community
- Consider a consultation with someone from the Libraries
Note: Here are a couple examples of items. In all, there are about 35 items from 8 sections.
---
@title[Sharing]
### Sharing as a Google Doc
- Quick to deploy
- Easy to share
- Add to your Drive as edit as necessary

http://go.ncsu.edu/post-award_dmpchecklist
Note: We created our working draft in google docs, but then decided it was the ideal way to share early versions. One reason was that it was accessible to both us and potential users. Also, since we knew our version couldn't cover specifics of all users, researchers can add our version to their own Drives and edit as needed.
---
@title[Campus feedback]
### Campus Feedback
- Institutional Review Board
- Office of Research, Innovation, and Economic Development
Note: To date we have shared with a limited audience. Our campus IRB reviewed it and advised that the checklist would be useful for when researchers were completing their IRB applications. Their hope was tighter integration between data management and researchers' IRBs.

@title[Annotated copy]
### Public vs Annotated Copies

> Good checklists...are precise. They are efficient, to the point, and easy to use...They do not try to spell out everything...

Atul Gawande, [Checklist Manifesto](http://atulgawande.com/book/the-checklist-manifesto/)

Note: The initial draft was much more detailed than the latest version. After reviewing the document with committee members, we decided to move some items into comments that liaisons could refer to when meeting with faculty to discuss implementing the checklist. The staff full-edit version contain annotations that are not visible in the public, read-only view. The result is that we have one canonical copy to manage.
---
@title[Additional work]
### Ongoing and future work
- Contacting researchers
- Web presence
- Promotion to community
Note: We have identified three researchers whose DMPs the RDC reviewed and whose grant applications were funded. Future work includes contacting and meeting them to discuss how they might use the checklist. We’d also like to establish a better web presence for the tool, and promote the tool to the community.
